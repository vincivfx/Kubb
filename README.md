## What is Kubb

When I was a student at italian high schools, I took part in various mathematical competitions, the one I liked the most was [Mathematics Team Olympiad (italian)](https://olimpiadi.dm.unibo.it/le-gare/gara-a-squadre/). 

To manage these competitions, a web platform called [PhiQuadro](https://phiquadro.it) was developed by Professor Sandro Campigotto. Unfortunately his platform was not open source and was not designed to run with thousands of people connected. So I decided to develop my own platform and make it open source, so that anyone could run their instances.
